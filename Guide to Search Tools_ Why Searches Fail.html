        <blockquote> 
          <p>No matter how carefully you design a search engine, there will always 
            be some searches that fail. Our search log analysis shows that it's 
            often a simple mistake or misunderstanding, so there's no one to blame. 
            Some search engines are better than others at finding useful matches 
            and providing <a href="http://www.searchtools.com/guide/nomatches.html">helpful pages</a> 
            when nothing can be found.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Top Five Reasons Why Searches Find No Matches</h3>
        <blockquote> 
          <h4><b>1. Empty searches</b></h4>
          <p>Amazing numbers of people just click the search button or press Return 
            when the cursor is in the search field. So the search engine gets 
            an empty query, which is usually treated as a search failure.</p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p> <b>What to do: </b> either chose a search engine which brings 
              up a helpful search page when the search is empty, or make sure 
              that you have wording on your <a href="http://www.searchtools.com/guide/nomatches.html">no-matches 
              page</a> to explain what is going on. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><b>2. Wrong Scope (trying to search the whole Web)</b></p>
          <p>Whether it's a site, Intranet or small portal, your search engine 
            covers only the topics on your site, not the entire Web. For example, 
            searching for <i>shot put</i> on a site about medieval art is just 
            as useless as searching for <i>marginalia </i>on a sports portal! 
            Despite this, people often see the search field or button, and think 
            they're getting a webwide search engine. If you look in your search 
            logs, you'll see the wide variety of searches which clearly are not 
            directed correctly.</p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p> <b>What to do: </b>Several search engines provide versions with 
              options to search the entire web, as well as the local site or portal. 
              In any case, the <a href="http://www.searchtools.com/guide/nomatches.html">no-matches page</a> 
              should explain the scope of the site and explain what materials 
              the search index covers. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><b>3. Vocabulary Mismatch</b> </p>
          <p>Searches containing terms which are too specific, too general or 
            just not used. For example, on a medical site, someone searching for 
            <i>doctor</i> may need to look for <i>physician;</i> a horse site 
            may talk about <i>Paso Finos </i> instead of <i>walking horses; </i>and 
            a beginning web design portal may not include any sites that get into 
            details on <i>onblur</i> tags, though they may have some links to 
            JavaScript pages. </p>
          <blockquote> 
            <h4><b>What to do</b></h4>
            <p>Some search engines perform linguistic <b>stemming</b> -- they 
              search for several forms of a word instead of just the exact match. 
              For example, a search for <i>run</i> might also find <i>running, 
              runs, ran,</i> or<i> runner;</i> a search for <i>goose</i> might 
              also look for <i>geese</i>. This makes it more likely that a search 
              will find a match, but must be implemented carefully so it doesn't 
              display inappropriate matches at the top of the results list. Note 
              that multilingual sites must be very careful in implementing the 
              correct stemming algorithm for each page's languages, or they may 
              return some very odd results. </p>
            <p>Adding <b>metadata</b> to pages can help match search words, especially 
              for broader and narrower terms. If you have pages describing <i>DSL 
              </i>and <i>cable modems</i> but never use the word <i>broadband</i>, 
              adding that term to the META Keywords tag content will allow the 
              search engine to find those pages</p>
            <p>Search engines may allow search administrators to set up <b>synonym 
              lists</b> or <b>thesari</b> to provide appropriate alternate terms. 
              For direct synonyms, such as <i>urticaria </i> as the technical 
              term for <i>hives</i>,<b> </b>it's appropriate to simply add that 
              to the query. For less obvious equivalents, such as <i>red</i> for 
              <i>crimson</i>, and for broader and narrower terms, the search engine 
              should display them and allow the searcher to click on them rather 
              than typing them in. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><b>4. Spelling Mistakes</b></p>
          <p>People make mistakes in spelling all the time. For simple typos, 
            log file analysis shows that searchers will re-enter the word correctly. 
            However, they often are unable to remember unfamiliar terms such as 
            diseases, product codes, and names in general. </p>
          <blockquote> 
            <h4>What to do </h4>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Synonym lists</b> (described above) can help with common 
                misspellings of important words on a site -- the engine can simply 
                translate the bad spelling to the correct version and continue. 
                <br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>A <b>spellchecker</b> can provide a list of correctly-spelled 
                words, allowing searchers to switch to the right spelling.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Complex Solutions</h4>
            <p>Information Retrieval theorists have come up with some clever solutions 
              to spelling errors, but they can be frustrating to users unless 
              presented properly. Be careful when implementing a search with fuzzy 
              matching: use usability testing and search logs to track whether 
              the results are substantially better than exact matching.<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Fuzzy matching</b> techniques try to reduce words to their 
                core and then match all forms of the word. For example, searching 
                for <i>serach</i> would properly locate <i>search</i>, but a search 
                for <i>locks</i> might find <i>looks</i>, whether or not that 
                was wanted. <br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li><b>Phonetic</b>, sound-alike or "Soundex" matching 
                uses linguistics to search for words which may sound similar. 
                This is particularly useful for names, so a search for <i>licos</i> 
                will find <i>Lycos</i>, but also brings up odd results: a search 
                for <i>fuzzie</i> may match <i>fees</i> or <i>face.</i> </li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
          <p><b>5. Query Requirements Not Met</b></p>
          <p>If the search engine automatically searches for all terms or a phrase, 
            or the query includes operators such as + or NOT, there may be no 
            pages which fulfill all the requirements. Examples include <i>brown 
            bear</i>(both terms), <i>"Olympic gold medal"</i> (phrase), 
            <i>claymation +British</i> (required term), <i>MP3 NOT Napster</i> 
            (excluded terms). </p>
          <p>This can also happen when searching in a particular section or <b>zone</b> 
            of a site for words which are used in different sections of the site. 
            Yahoo and CNet are good examples where people can limit searches to 
            a subsection, but searching for <i>roses</i> in the <i>tropical fish</i> 
            area will never find a match.</p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><b>What to do: </b>Search engines which show the number of pages 
              matched for each term are particularly helpful in this case. The 
              <a href="http://www.searchtools.com/guide/nomatches.html">no-matches page</a> can clarify 
              which of the terms caused the problem and provide advice on how 
              to enlarge the search.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Other Causes of Search Failure</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Problems with Query Syntax</b>: some search engines are very 
            picky about how the query must be entered. If a searcher puts a space 
            after an operator such as +, or uses <i>NOT</i> instead of <i>AND 
            NOT</i>, the search may fail. 
            <ul>
              <li>The search engine should provide helpful error messages and 
                instructions in this case, or better yet, be more accepting in 
                its query parsing. For example, if a close parenthesis ")" 
                is missing, the engine can simply add it at the end of the query, 
                with an explanatory message in the results page.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote> 
          <h4></h4>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li><b> Capitalization and Extended Characters</b>: some search engines 
            require exact matches for capital letters and diacritical characters 
            (such as ü, ß, ñ). In that case, searches for <i>pokeman</i> 
            will never find pages with the word <i>Pokéman. </i> 
            <ul>
              <li>If your search engine is strict about these elements, make sure 
                that explain the problem on the <a href="http://www.searchtools.com/guide/nomatches.html">no-matches 
                page</a>. <br>
                <br>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Stopwords</b>: to save index space and time, some search engine 
            just don't include common words in their index. This can range from 
            prepositions and conjunctions (such as <i>a, an, the, with, from</i>) 
            to words which are extremely common within the index (<i>baseball 
            </i>and <i>TV </i>on a sports site, for example). Unfortunately, people 
            often search for these terms (think of <i>As You Like It</i>) and 
            are confused when they can't find the pages which contain them. 
            <ul>
              <li>If your search engine must use stopwords, make sure the <a href="http://www.searchtools.com/guide/nomatches.html">no-matches 
                page</a> explains what they are and how to search around them. 
                <br>
                <br>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Short Words:</b> some search engines have a lower-size limit 
            for indexing words, so they don't have to store thousands of entries 
            for the word <i>I</i> and other short words. However, if those are 
            required parts of a search, omitting them from the index means that 
            the search nay not find any matches (<i>to be or not to be, </i>for 
            example). 
            <ul>
              <li>Whenever possible, index everything. If your search engine will 
                not index short words, make sure the <a href="http://www.searchtools.com/guide/nomatches.html">no-matches 
                page</a> explains how to search around them. <br>
                <br>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Numbers: </b>some search engines don't index numbers, either 
            because they are short or just because they are not words. But people 
            search on them all the time! 
            <ul>
              <li>If your search engine will not index them, make sure the <a href="http://www.searchtools.com/guide/nomatches.html">no-matches 
                page</a> explains that numbers can't be searched.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Avoiding Future Failure</h3>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Be sure to track your search logs so you can see why and how your 
            customers are having problems with search. Watch those searches that 
            find 0 matches like a hawk, and do your best to add new synonyms, 
            terms and information that addresses these questions.</p>
