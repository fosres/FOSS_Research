<HR>

MG is an open-source
indexing and retrieval system for text, images, and textual images.
MG is covered by a 
<a href="http://mds.rmit.edu.au/mg/intro/copying.html">GNU 
public licence</a>.
<P>
The current version of MG is available for ftp from
<a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/mg/">http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/mg/</a>.

<h3>Developers</h3>

The MG system is an embodiment of ideas developed primarily by:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~tim">Tim C. Bell</a>,
	University of Canterbury;
<li> <a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~alistair">Alistair Moffat</a>,
	University of Melbourne;
<li> <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ihw">Ian Witten</a>,
	University of Waikato; and
<li> <a href="http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/~jz">Justin Zobel</a>,
	RMIT.
</ul>

<h3>Programmers</h3>

The bulk of the programming work has been undertaken by:
<ul>
<li>Stuart Inglis,
       University of Waikato;
<li>Craig Nevill-Manning
       University of Waikato;
<li> Neil Sharman, University of Melbourne; and
<li> Tim Shimmin, RMIT.
</ul>
A full list of contributors appears
in the README file that is part of the software package.

<h3>Institutional Support</h3>

The MG project has been supported by the following organisations:
<ul>
<li>	The Australian Research Council;
<li>	Collaborative Information Technology Research Institute, Melbourne;
<li>	The <a HREF="http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/">University
		of Calgary</a>, Canada;

		of Canterbury</a>, New Zealand;

<h3>Pointers</h3>

If you didn't just come from there, the MG home page is at <a
href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/mg/">http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/mg/</a>.

<p>
Further detailed information about the software (including examples
and man pages) is available at <a
href="http://www.mds.rmit.edu.au/mg/">http://www.mds.rmit.edu.au/mg/</a>;
and while that set of web pages has not been updated for
mg-1.2.1, most of the information they contain is still correct.

<p>
The original ftp site at <tt>munnari.oz.au/pub/mg</tt> is now defunct.

<h3>Comments and Bug Reports</h3>

These should be sent to <a
href="mailto:alistair@cs.mu.oz.au">Alistair Moffat</a>.
In particular, note that Tim Shimmin (listed as being at
<tt>tes@kbs.citri.edu.au</tt>, but that address is now defunct)
is no longer associated
with this project and is unlikely to respond to any mail you may send
him.
<p>
And do please be aware that if you send suggestions for added
"features", or bug reports, there is little likelihood of any
immediate response apart from a "thank you for letting me know", as
we currently have no funded support for MG, and any software development is
voluntary on the part of my students.
What I do guarantee is that your mail will be retained against the
eventuality that one day someone does give us $50,000 for further
software development.
And if you have $50,000 you don't need,
and thought MG was wonderful, well, 
remember us...
